# üìì Work with Databases

Here I would like to showcase my work with databases written in Russian Language to demonstrate my ability to work in the second languauge too. As an example I used the [Demoshopping.ru](https://demoshopping.ru/) webstore's database and as for the tools, I used üê¨ MySQL Workbench and üçÉ MongoDB.
1. [MySQL Worckbench. SELECT-queries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BLSwT8LAUESh0bZOp9NpFvflU0Rkv0I8DL60lEDH8sI/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

   Executing SELECT-queries to the webstore's database via MySQL Workbench.

2. [MySQL Worckbench. JOIN-queries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o46G7DiI1IFqceeXA24FtqWvFshR2nPKC7y_dwyb0os/edit?usp=sharing)

   Executing JOIN-queries to the webstore's database via MySQL Workbench.

3. [Work with Databases via MongoDB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgYDJjSMHT5677kghuHIX6nbL-6WmaVtDirSrhDHdIc/edit?usp=sharing)

   Creating a collection in MongoDB, running queries and working with the database.
